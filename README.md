🧰 Technologies Used
HTML5 — semantic markup for structure.

CSS3 — custom styles for layout and design.

Font Awesome — icon library for cart and star ratings.

⚙️ How It Works
Navigation:
The sticky header keeps navigation visible at all times, improving user experience.

Hero Section:
Features promotional offers and a CTA button styled with a custom background.

Features Section:
Highlights selling points such as free shipping, 24/7 support, and promotions with icon boxes.

Product Sections:
Displays featured products and new arrivals in a flexible, responsive grid layout. Each product has:

Image

Brand name

Product title

Star rating icons

Price

Add-to-cart icon

Promotional Banners:
Includes static banners for seasonal offers and sales, styled with hover effects.

🎯 Usage
Clone this repository or download the source files.

Place your product images in the product photos/ directory.

Update product info and links in ecommerce.html as needed.

Open ecommerce.html in your browser to see the website.

✨ Next Steps
This template is purely front-end and static. To turn it into a full-fledged e-commerce site, you can:

Integrate a backend (Node.js, Django, Laravel, etc.) for user authentication, product management, and payments.

Connect a real product database and shopping cart system.

Add interactive JavaScript (e.g., product filtering, dynamic cart updates).

Optimize for SEO and performance.

💡 Best Practices Applied
✔️ Clear and semantic HTML structure
✔️ DRY and reusable CSS classes
✔️ Proper use of external resources (CDN for Font Awesome)
✔️ Organized sections with meaningful IDs for maintainability
✔️ Responsive design considerations (flex and wrap)
